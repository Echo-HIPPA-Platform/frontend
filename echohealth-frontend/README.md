This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## SEO & Sitemap

This project uses [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap) to automatically generate a sitemap.xml and robots.txt for better SEO. After building the project, the sitemap is generated automatically via the `postbuild` script.

### How to generate sitemap

After running `npm run build`, the sitemap and robots.txt will be created in the `public/` directory. You can also run:

```bash
npm run postbuild
```

### SEO Metadata

- The site name is set to **Echo Psychology**.
- The description and keywords are optimized for mental health, therapy, and wellness services.
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags are included for rich social sharing.
